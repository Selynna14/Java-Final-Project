//Github Docuemntation 

//We used GitHub's features a lot in our project, primarily for code sharing and collaboration. Its platform allowed us to make our code available to everyone in the group. Which allowed teamwork and easy access to the latest updates. One important aspect that Github provided was showing who and when they made the last edit to the file or who created the files. We organized our work into different branches, with the main branch dedicated to coding. Other branches were designated for various designs, such as furniture, weapons, characters, game screens, etc. This structure kept our project well organized. Overall, GitHub played a vital role in our work and collaboration among group members.
